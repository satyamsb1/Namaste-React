* What is a pollyfill
		If browser donot understand our code we convert new code (replacement code) to older code which it understands this process is carried by bable.

* Bable uses Browserslist.

* package.json 
	"browserslist":[
    		"last 2 Chrome versions"
  	] 
	This means code can run on any browser but it will definitely work on last 2 Chrome versions.
